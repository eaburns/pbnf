To Do
------------------------

(Wheeler) rough draft
 mash Seth and Ethan's papers together

(Seth) 3 6x6 puzzles

(Ethan) weighted PBNF

(Ethan) run everything and plot everything on everything

(Ethan) figure out why we suck on tiles
  then, worry about general fix like division trick

(Seth) Implement other types of learning for min expansions???

(Seth) little bibliography: list of papers and why they do not perform well.

(???) Wted A* for large problems

(Seth) A* with lock-free datastructures -- maybe this will be great
  - Look at tfogal's lock-free hashtable
  - Look at Kumar's lock-free Prio-queue
     survey, also hurt et al

(Ethan/Seth) Read Edelkamp's "External A*"

--------------------

- (Ethan) Create NBlocks lazily in PBNF and PSDD

- (Ethan) code tweaks
  - don't generate parent
  - detect duplicates in open list (without issues freeing path)

- (Ethan) colored grid per-thread colors

- (Seth) Another domain (hanoi, pancake [yum], MSA, etc.)

- (Ethan) Look into possible contention on LAMA globals
