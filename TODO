To Do
------------------------

(Wheeler) rough draft
 mash Seth and Ethan's papers together

(Rong) fix min-expansions
       run 3 times at each setting to account for concurrency non-determinism

(Seth) results with 3x4 tiles
 across all abstractions
 get intervals small

(Ethan) results with new grid abstraction (unit & life)

(Ethan) iterative deepening breadth-first PSDD

(Rong) Results on planning with unsafe and safe
  figure out why we don't do well on some problems
  port code to 64-bits
  results on Sun

(Ethan) figure out why we suck on tiles
  then, worry about general fix like division trick

(Ethan) look into PBNF with 5nblocks/thread and 1 thread... it
  performs very poorly.

(Ethan) run everything on Sun

(Ethan) Implement 8-way movement in gridworld (need real value costs,
  sqrt(2) diagonals)

(???) Wted A* for large problems

(Seth) PRA* improvements
 eg, Cancel threads

(Seth) KBFS improvements
 no locks, busy waiting

(Seth) Implement learning for min expansions

(Ethan/Seth) Read Edelkamp's "External A*"

(???) PSDD with some kind of f-range

(Seth) A* with lock-free datastructures -- maybe this will be great
  - Look at tfogal's lock-free hashtable
  - Look at Kumar's lock-free Prio-queue
     survey, also hurt et al

--------------------

- (Ethan) Create NBlocks lazily in PBNF and PSDD

- (Ethan) colored grid per-thread colors

- (Seth) Another domain (hanoi, pancake [yum], MSA, etc.)

- (Ethan) Look into possible contention on LAMA globals
