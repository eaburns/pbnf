- (Seth) Check out PRA*

- (Seth) Another domain (hanoi, pancake [yum], MSA, etc.)
   
- (Seth) A* with lock-free datastructures -- maybe this will be great
   - Look at tfogal's lock-free hashtable
   - Look at Kumar's lock-free Prio-queue

- (Seth) Implement Parallel Window Search

- (Ethan) Implement 8-way movement in gridworld (need real value costs,
   sqrt(2) diagonals)

- plot vs. A*

- only first thread sleeps on better non-free nblock
    - or maybe no one sleeps?

- (Ethan) gprof

- colored grid per-thread colors
   
- Figure out if we want PSDD to use uniform-cost search or just BFS
   -- we only care about unit costs for now

- (Ethan) Look into possible contention on LAMA globals

------------------------------------------------------------

- (Ethan) Get a benchmark for speedup by running multiple A* searches
   in seperate threads.  This should show the max speed up of the
   comupter without communication. (will help figure out why 4threads
   is our limit).
   
- (Seth/Ethan) Write scripts for DB input/output

- (Seth) update algorithm description to reflect livelock fix

- Find a name for our new search: PBNF (Parallel Best Nblock First)

- Find multi-core comupter

- Give Wheeler the Grant Proposal
   
- (Ethan) Create GridWorld
   
- (Ethan) Create a projection function for GridWorld

- (Ethan) Implement Parallel Structured Duplicate Detection
   
- (Ethan) Create a Breadth First Search

- (Seth) Parallel KBFS

- (Ethan) Implement PBNF

- (Seth) Write testing script

- (Seth) Implement parallel A*

- (Ethan) Look into using Wheeler's database code

- (Ethan) Get a benchmark for speedup by running multiple A* searches
   in seperate threads.  This should show the max speed up of the
   comupter without communication. (will help figure out why 4threads
   is our limit).

- (Ethan) Finish Sliding tiles
   - implement projection
