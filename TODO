- (Ethan) gprof

- Get a benchmark for speedup by running multiple A* searches in
   seperate threads.  This should show the max speed up of the
   comupter without communication overhead.

- Look into using Wheeler's database code

- Get graphs for Wheeler
   
- Figure out if we want PSDD to use uniform-cost search or just BFS

- Another domain (hanoi, pancake [yum], etc.)

- (Ethan) Find good parameters for PSDD

- (Ethan) Sliding tiles

- (Seth) Look into MSA as test domain
   
- (Seth) Implement Parallel Window Search

- Look at tfogal's lock-free hashtable
   
- Look at Kumar's lock-free Prio-queue

- A* with lock-free datastructures -- maybe this will be great
   
- Implement 8-way movement in gridworld (need real value costs, sqrt(2) diagonals)   

- (Ethan) Look into possible contention on LAMA globals

------------------------------------------------------------

- Find a name for our new search: PBNF (Parallel Best Nblock First)

- Find multi-core comupter

- Give Wheeler the Grant Proposal
   
- (Ethan) Create GridWorld
   
- (Ethan) Create a projection function for GridWorld

- (Ethan) Implement Parallel Structured Duplicate Detection
   
- (Ethan) Create a Breadth First Search

- (Seth) Parallel KBFS

- (Ethan) Implement PBNF

- (Seth) Write testing script

- (Seth) Implement parallel A*
