To Do
------------------------

(Wheeler) rough draft
 mash Seth and Ethan's papers together
   
(Seth) Update PRA*, PA*, KBFS to close states at generation

(Ethan) BFPSDD, PSDD close states as appropriate (possibly during generation)
   
(Seth) results with 3x4 tiles
 across all abstractions
 get intervals small

(Ethan) results with new grid abstraction (unit, life, four-way, eight-way)
   (Ethan) BFPSDD with >625 nblocks
   (Ethan) SAFEPBNF with > 180 min expansions

(Rong) Results on planning with unsafe and safe
  figure out why we don't do well on some problems
  port code to 64-bits
  results on Sun

(Ethan) figure out why we suck on tiles
  then, worry about general fix like division trick

(Ethan) look into PBNF with 5nblocks/thread and 1 thread... it
  performs very poorly.
   
(Ethan) Re-run data with algs new usage of closed list

(Ethan) run everything on Sun

(Seth) PRA* improvements
 eg, Cancel threads

(Seth) Implement learning for min expansions

(Ethan) with some kind of f-range or min expansions (% or _#_) per nblock
   
(Seth) little bibliography: list of papers and why they do not perform well.

(???) Wted A* for large problems

(Seth) A* with lock-free datastructures -- maybe this will be great
  - Look at tfogal's lock-free hashtable
  - Look at Kumar's lock-free Prio-queue
     survey, also hurt et al

(Ethan/Seth) Read Edelkamp's "External A*"

--------------------

- (Ethan) Create NBlocks lazily in PBNF and PSDD

- (Ethan) code tweaks
  - don't generate parent
  - detect duplicates in open list (without issues freeing path)

- (Ethan) colored grid per-thread colors

- (Seth) Another domain (hanoi, pancake [yum], MSA, etc.)

- (Ethan) Look into possible contention on LAMA globals
