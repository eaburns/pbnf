- Find a name for our new search

- Get graphs for Wheeler
   
- Figure out if we want PSDD to use uniform-cost search or just BFS

- Another domain (hanoi, pancake [yum], etc.)

- (Seth) Straight parallel A*, locks and all

- (Ethan) Find good parameters for PSDD

- (Ethan) Sliding tiles
   
- (Seth) Create scripts to run all of our searches
   - Look into using Wheeler's database code
   
- (Seth) Implement Parallel Window Search

- Look at tfogal's lock-free hashtable
   
- Look at Kumar's lock-free Prio-queue
   - A* with lock-free datastructures -- maybe this will be great
   
- Implement 8-way movement in gridworld (need real value costs, sqrt(2) diagonals)   

- (Ethan) Look into possible contention on LAMA globals
