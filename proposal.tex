\section{Problem}

Over the past few decades we have seen major increases in the
processing speeds of CPUs.  We are coming to a point, however, where
it is no longer feasible to create processors with higher clock
speeds.  It is widely accepted that the next generations of computers
are going to rely on parallelism instead of processor cycles for
increased performance.  In order to make better use of this upcoming
hardware, the artificial intelligence community will need to begin
creating algorithms that make use of concurrency between multiple CPU
cores.

Heuristic search is one of the most fundamental tools used in the
field of artificial intelligence.  Heuristic search is used to explore
possible actions that can be taken in order to achieve a goal.  This
technique generalizes across many problem domains.  Today, most
heuristic search algorithms are sequential; they only make use of a
single processor core.  In order to adapt the field of artificial
intelligence to the next generation of computers, we believe that it
will be necessary to reformulate search algorithms so that they can
take advantage of parallel computing.

\section{Goal}

Our goal for this project is to explore novel methods of performing
heuristic search on machines with many CPU cores. We hope to examine algorithms that memorize memory contention while spreading the work out among cores as efficiently as possible. Any algorithms we design or examine should be generalizable across as many domains as possible, but efficient regardless of the number of cores available.

\section{Approach}

\begin{itemize}


\item Implement algorithms known:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item DTS
  \item Parallel window search
  \item PRA*
  \item Parallel A* with shared OPEN list?
  \end{itemize}

\item Attempt to create a new parallel best first search algorithm:\\
  search(init, cores)
\begin{algorithmic}
  \STATE create a thread for each core, giving each a link to its ''right'' neighbor and a queue for messages from its ''left'' neighbor
  \STATE give the initial node to first thread
  \WHILE{any thread has nodes on its OPEN list}
    \FOR {$i=0$ to min(n, length of OPEN list)}
      \STATE expand first node on OPEN list
      \IF{node is goal}
        \STATE create goal token
        \STATE gotgoal(goal)
      \ENDIF
    \ENDFOR
    \STATE send first node on OPEN list ''right''
    \STATE receive message from ''left'' queue
    \IF{message is goal token}
      \STATE gotgoal(goal)
    \ELSIF{message is node}
      \STATE insert into OPEN list
    \ENDIF
  \ENDWHILE
  \end{algorithmic}
  gotgoal(goal)
  \begin{algorithmic}
      \IF{g value is less than current incumbent}
        \STATE prune all nodes off OPEN list with g values higher than goal
        \IF{if OPEN list is not empty}
          \STATE mark goal as incumbent
          \ENDIF
        \STATE pass goal ''right''
      \ENDIF
  \end{algorithmic}

\item Refine the, above mentioned, algorithm.

\item Model our new idea using TLA for proofs.

\item Test our new algorithm against previous parallel algorithms
  listed above.

\end{itemize}
