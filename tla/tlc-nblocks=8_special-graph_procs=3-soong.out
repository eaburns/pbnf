Implied-temporal checking--satisfiability problem has 8 branches.
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated.
Progress(5): 3275 states generated, 1185 distinct states found, 778 states left on queue.
--Checking temporal properties for the complete state space...
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
    calculated (optimistic):  8.434626695003056E-12
    based on the actual fingerprints:  6.251251461863047E-13
31465 states generated, 6145 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 11.
