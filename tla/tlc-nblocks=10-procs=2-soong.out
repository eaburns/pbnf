Implied-temporal checking--satisfiability problem has 10 branches.
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated.
Progress(6): 1864 states generated, 494 distinct states found, 298 states left on queue.
--Checking temporal properties for the complete state space...
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
    calculated (optimistic):  1.4666935201079756E-12
    based on the actual fingerprints:  1.274850773358838E-13
14681 states generated, 2161 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 9.
