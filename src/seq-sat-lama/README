This directory contains the implementation of LAMA, as it was
used in the 6th international planning competition (IPC-6).

Build the planner by typing

./build

and use the run script "plan" with the following parameters

./plan <domain_path> <problem_path>

The run script contains the settings used for LAMA during IPC-6.
For other possible parameters look into the source code (planner.cc)
and modify the run script accordingly.

Have fun,
