\begin{abstract}
We are approaching a time when it will no longer be beneficial for
hardware manufactures to create micro-processors with greater clock
speeds.  In order to get increased performance, software developers
will need to take advantage of concurrency and multi-core processors.
We propose a best-first search algorithm which makes use of multiple
core CPUs in order to more quickly solve search problems which are
small enough to fit into memory.

\section{Introduction}

As microprocessor manufacturers build processors with more and more
cores, software developers are pressured to create algorithms to make
better use of the newly available parallelism.
