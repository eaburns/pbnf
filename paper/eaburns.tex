\begin{abstract}
We are approaching a time where it is no longer beneficial for
hardware manufactures to create micro-processors with greater and
greater clock speeds.  In order to get increased performance, software
will need to be written to take advantage of concurrency and
multi-core processors.  We propose a best-first search algorithm which
makes use of multiple core CPUs in order to solve small to medium
sized problems faster.
