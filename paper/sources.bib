Abstract = {{In this paper we describe a variant of A{*} search designed to run on
   the massively parallel, SIMD Connection Machine (CM-2).  The algorithm
   is designed to run in a limited memory by the use of a retraction
   technique which allows nodes with poor heuristic values to be removed
   from the open list until such time as they may need reexpansion, more
   promising paths having failed.  Our algorithm, called PRA{*} (for
   Parallel Retraction A{*}), is designed to maximize use of the
   Connection Machine's memory and processors.  In addition, the algorithm
   is guaranteed to return an optimal path when an admissible heuristic is
   used.  Results comparing PRA{*} to Korf's IDA{*} for the fifteen puzzle
   show significantly fewer node expansions for PRA{*}.  In addition,
   empirical results show significant parallel speedups, indicative of the
   algorithm's design for high processor utilization.  (C) 1995 Academic

Abstract = {{We introduce a new algorithm, K-best-first search (KBFS), which is a
   generalization of the well known best-first search (BFS). In KBFS, each
   iteration simultaneously expands the K best nodes from the open-list
   (rather than just the best as in BFS). We claim that KBFS outperforms
   BFS in domains where the heuristic function has large errors in
   estimation of the real distance to the goal state or does not predict
   dead-ends in the search tree. We present empirical results that confirm
   this claim and show that KBFS outperforms BFS by a factor of 15 on
   random trees with dead-ends, and by a factor of 2 and 7 on the Fifteen
   and Twenty-Four tile puzzles, respectively. KBFS also finds better
   solutions than BFS and hill-climbing for the number partitioning
   problem. KBFS is only appropriate for finding approximate solutions
   with inadmissible heuristic functions.}},
